## Overview

This challenge allowed me to test and use new CSS elements I learnt recently and attempting to write DRYer code. Positioning was the biggest barrier I had with this but managed to overcome with the use of flexbox. The hover effects were added and it allowed me to utilize new ways for hover. I used the box model image to understand how to position different elements

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
